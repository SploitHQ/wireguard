# WireGuard

**WireGuard** is a modern, lightweight, and fast VPN protocol designed to be simpler and more secure than older solutions like IPsec and OpenVPN. It uses state-of-the-art cryptography and is built directly into the Linux kernel for performance and minimal attack surface.

## üîç What can WireGuard do?

- Create fast and secure VPN tunnels using modern cryptography
- Use simple configuration files for quick setup
- Support roaming and mobile devices with seamless key exchange
- Provide built-in NAT traversal and IPv6 support
- Integrate directly into the OS (Linux kernel module, Windows client, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

### Bring up a WireGuard interface from config
```
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

This uses `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` or the file specified with `wg-quick`.

## üß™ Examples

### Generate key pair
```
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```

### Sample client configuration (`wg0.conf`)
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
Address = 10.0.0.2/24
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
Endpoint = vpn.example.com:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### Bring up the VPN
```
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

### Tear down the VPN
```
sudo wg-quick down wg0
```

### Check connection status
```
sudo wg show
```
